<section id="palestine-2025" class="article-section bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg p-6">
  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Palestine â€“ A Cry for Justice and Humanity</h2>
  <p class="text-justify leading-7">
    The struggle of Palestine is not just a political issue â€” it is a humanitarian crisis that has touched the hearts of millions across the globe. From Gaza to the West Bank, the people of Palestine live each day under siege, facing shortages of food, clean water, electricity, and medical aid. This article explores the deep sorrow, the history of the conflict, and the urgent call for justice that unites voices worldwide.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Historical Background</strong><br>
    Palestineâ€™s story is one of resilience in the face of decades of occupation and displacement. Families have been uprooted from their homes, children have grown up knowing only the sound of conflict, and generations have been forced to live as refugees.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Current Situation in 2025</strong><br>
    In 2025, the humanitarian situation has reached critical levels. The blockade of Gaza has cut off essential supplies. Hospitals run without adequate medical equipment, and schools are often destroyed or used as shelters. Every bombing leaves a trail of loss, forcing survivors to start over yet again.
    <br><br>

          <td class="border p-2">Malnutrition among vulnerable groups</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>
    <strong>Global Response</strong><br>
    Across the world, protests and campaigns demand justice for Palestine. Human rights organizations call for an end to occupation and for humanitarian aid to reach those in need. However, political complexities often delay or weaken international action.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Why We Must Speak Out</strong><br>
    Silence in the face of oppression is complicity. To stand with Palestine means standing for universal human rights, dignity, and freedom. Every voice matters in bringing global attention to the plight of the Palestinian people.
