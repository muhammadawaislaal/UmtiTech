  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Palestine – A Cry for Justice and Humanity</h2>

  <p class="lead">
    For generations, the people of <strong>Palestine</strong> have endured a relentless humanitarian crisis — a conflict marked by displacement, poverty, and the heartbreaking loss of innocent lives. The pain of Palestine is not a distant tragedy; it is a global wound that speaks to the very soul of humanity.
    <br><br>
    Every day in Gaza and the West Bank, life is a struggle for survival. Children dream not of toys but of safety. Parents work tirelessly, often risking their own lives, to provide food and water for their families. Yet, in the face of unimaginable suffering, the resilience of the Palestinian spirit remains unbroken.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-title">Key Facts About the Palestine Crisis</h3>
  <table aria-label="Key facts about Palestine crisis">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Category</th>
        <th>Details</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Population Affected</td><td>Over 5 million people living under occupation or blockade</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Displaced People</td><td>More than 1.7 million displaced due to conflict</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Children in Need</td><td>Nearly 50% of Gaza’s population are children requiring urgent aid</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Basic Resources</td><td>Severe shortages of water, food, electricity, and medical supplies</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3 class="section-title">The Human Side of the Crisis</h3>
  <p>
    Behind every statistic is a real person. A child like Mariam, who once dreamed of becoming a doctor, now studies in a classroom with broken walls and no electricity. A father like Ahmed, who walks miles to find clean water for his family. A grandmother like Fatima, who carries the memories of her homeland before the destruction.
    <br><br>
    These stories are not rare — they are the reality for millions in Palestine. Each one is a reminder that the conflict is not about politics alone; it is about the lives of human beings who deserve dignity and peace.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-title">Recent Major Events (2025)</h3>
  <table aria-label="Recent major events 2025">
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Date</th><th>Event</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>July 28, 2025</td><td>International protests in over 40 countries demanding a ceasefire</td></tr>
      <tr><td>August 2, 2025</td><td>UN calls for immediate humanitarian access to Gaza</td></tr>
      <tr><td>August 6, 2025</td><td>Humanitarian aid convoy delayed at border crossings</td></tr>

    “We bake the bread with trembling hands and share what little we have—because that is what remains of our dignity.” — A mother in Gaza
  </blockquote>

  <h3 class="section-title">How You Can Help</h3>
  <p>
    Spread awareness, donate to verified relief organizations (UNRWA, Islamic Relief, Palestine Children’s Relief Fund), participate in peaceful advocacy, and contact your elected representatives to demand action and access for humanitarian aid.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion — A Moral Call</h3>
  <p>
    The struggle of Palestine is a mirror reflecting the moral state of the world. It challenges us to decide who we are — a global community united by empathy or divided by indifference. We must amplify their voices, share their stories, and pressure leaders to choose humanity over politics.
